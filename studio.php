            Mr. Xia uses the suzuki and traditional methods for teaching violin and viola. The suzuki method is based on language acquisition theories in that by creating a positive environment, students can learn and excel at music. The suzuki cirriculum books 1 - 4 are taught in tandem with classical methods such as warming up with scales and etudes. As many of suzuki’s pieces are from the baroque period, advance students’ repitore will include concertos and other peices from different time period composors in the romantic, modern, and classical era.
